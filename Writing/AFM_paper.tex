\title{Anti-ferromagnetic Ising Model in Hierarchical Networks }

\begin{abstract}
The Ising antiferromagnet  is a convenient model of glassy dynamics.  It can introduce geometric frustrations and may give rise to a spin glass phase and glassy relaxation at low temperatures.  We apply the antiferromagnetic Ising model to 4 hierarchical networks which share features of both small world networks and regular lattices. Their recursive and fixed structures make them suitable for exact renormalization group analysis as well as numerical simulations. We first explore the dynamical behaviors using simulated annealing and discover an extremely slow relaxation at low temperatures. Then we employ renormalization group to study the equilibrium properties in the thermodynamic limit with a range of bond strengthes, and we found paramagnetic phase, spin glass phase, ferromagnetic phase, and chaotic behavior in different networks. Moreover, a rich phase diagram is proposed based on the transitions points among these phases.
